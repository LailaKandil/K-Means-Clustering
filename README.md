This project implements the K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch using Euclidean distance as the similarity metric

K-Means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning data into k distinct clusters based on feature similarity. This implementation focuses on understanding the fundamental workings of the algorithm without relying on high-level ML libraries.
